        <h2>Web Design</h2>
        <p>Web Design is another discipline I had not considered before college, but has proved more interesting and fun than I expected. Before taking Interactive Media I (DES 117), I thought of coding languages as something that is difficult to learn and would not provide me with much satisfaction. Many of my family members work(ed) in the tech industry, and the idea of doing something related to that realm frightened me, but learning the basics of HTML and CSS showed me that there is more to this design discipline than I thought. 

            While taking the first course of the Interactive Media series, I was able to pair my prior knowledge of graphic design and UI/UX principles with the lessons I learned in class. While other courses I have taken at UC Davis let me connect different disciplines together, this course felt the most interconnected. I was able to take inspiration from the navigation I included in my UI/UX projects, practice color contrast like in graphic design, and even include my own photography while participating in the assignments and projects. 
            
            Reading portions of the 5th edition of the book Learning Web Design solidified my learning in DES 117. The author even introduced UI/UX and graphic design to emphasize the relationship between these disciplines (Robbins, 2018). Recommended devices for practicing web design include an up-to-date computer,  a monitor, a second computer for testing (which can be a friendâ€™s), a mobile device, and a scanner/camera (Robbins, 2018). One aspect of web design I find particularly intriguing is Cascading Style Sheets (more commonly known as CSS). A benefit of CSS stylesheets is that a single one can be linked to multiple HTML pages (Robbins, 2018). This streamlines the process of designing a website as each internal page does not necessarily have to be styled separately. As I learned in class, CSS allows designers to create layouts such as grids, adjust the sizing of content boxes, and more.
