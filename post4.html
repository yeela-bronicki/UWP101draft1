        <h2>Web Design</h2>
        <p> Web Design is another discipline I had not considered before college, but has proved more interesting and fun than I expected. Before taking Interactive Media I (DES 117), I thought of coding languages as something that is difficult to learn and would not provide me with much satisfaction. DES 117 provided information on the foundational parts of web design and taught HTML and CSS. <br> <br> This first course of the Interactive Media series allows students to turn their prior knowledge of graphic design and UI/UX into responsive designs that are accessible on the web. Based on this, I found DES 117 as one of the most interconnected courses available in the Design program. However, almost all design courses I have taken encourage/require students to pull in information from prior learning. Personally, I was able to take inspiration from the navigation I included in my UI/UX projects, practice color contrast like in graphic design, and even include my own photography while participating in the assignments and projects. <br> <br> Reading portions of the 5th edition of the book Learning Web Design solidified the teachings of DES 117. The author even introduced UI/UX and graphic design to emphasize the relationship between these disciplines (Robbins, 2018). Recommended devices for practicing web design include an up-to-date computer,  a monitor, a second computer for testing (which can be a friend's), a mobile device, and a scanner/camera (Robbins, 2018). <br> <br> One aspect of web design I find particularly intriguing is Cascading Style Sheets (more commonly known as CSS). A benefit of CSS stylesheets is that a single sheet can be linked to multiple HTML pages (Robbins, 2018). This streamlines the process of designing a website as each internal page does not necessarily have to be styled separately. As I learned in class, CSS allows designers to create layouts such as grids, adjust the sizing of content boxes, and more. <br> <br> Like graphic design, where the job title is the same as the discipline, knowing web design helps designers get jobs called as such.
