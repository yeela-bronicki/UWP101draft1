        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <h3>About the Blog</h3>
        <p>As I reflected on my coursework and research while working on this blog, I realized that design disciplines are interwoven yet unique. Having such a broad variety of courses at UC Davis has been instrumental in my career-finding journey and in putting together this project. I selected the topic of design careers, as influenced by my personal experiences- which will be discussed in the other section of this introductory post and the rest of the blog. I will be presenting information about three design disciplines that I have experience with and seem to be promising careers. <br>I chose to write about graphic design, UI/UX, and web design and how these disciplines connect to a post-graduation career due to their popularity within the design program and my previous experience with courses. For any new design students reading this, here are some very brief one-sentence descriptions of these kinds of design:
            <ul>
                <li>Graphic design sends messages through visual communication.</li>
                <li>UI/UX refers to user interface and user experience design, or the ways a design product looks (UI) and how a user will interact with it (UX).</li>
                <li>Web design plans and arranges content on a webpage that allows it to be shared.</li>
              </ul></p> <p>Throughout this blog, I will combine knowledge from my personal experience in UC Davis design courses and secondary research. I will highlight connections between these disciplines, especially as it relates to coursework offered at UC Davis in the design department in order to create a more comprehensive look at design possibilities.

        <h3>About the Author</h3>

       <p> Hello, my name is Ye'ela Bronicki. As of writing this, I am a Design major at UC Davis, graduating in June 2025. I was inspired by my experience as a student to create this blog in order to reflect on my steps toward a design career while providing insight to my design peers. During my time as a student at UC Davis, I have taken a variety of courses. They range from sustainable design to the history of interior architecture, and photography to coding. As the program at UC Davis is so broad, I found that it can be overwhelming to figure out which classes I am most interested in. My goal for this blog is to make the course selection process easier for my peers and help them (and me) determine what options feel most interesting.  <br>
        As I am working towards finding a job post-graduation, I chose to code and design this blog site. I used my HTML (HyperText Markup Language, a coding language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets, a design programming language) skills to create a responsive layout for desktop and mobile devices and created the visuals for each post using my knowledge and past projects as applicable. I selected graphic design, web design, and UI/UX to write about within the time frame of the course since I realized connections between them prior to my research (through my coursework) and they are popular career choices that I think remain somewhat mysterious to college students.
