        <h2>UI/UX</h2>
        <p>Before attending college, I had only briefly heard about this design discipline through my parents and grandparents who work(ed) in the tech industry. As I asked friends and classmates for recommended design courses to register for, a common one was “Principles of UI/UX” (DES 112). <br> <br>The structure of this course helped me understand what goes into UI/UX without going too deep due to the fast pace of the quarter system. While this is the only course I have taken directly related to UI/UX, it taught me a lot about the foundations of the discipline. Some memorable moments in the class are learning about the spectrum of pathways. I got to learn that UI and UX design work together, but that an individual does not need to master both in order to find a job. I found myself leaning toward UI ( user interface) design and was pleasantly surprised that around half of the coursework was related to this. <br> <br>I enjoyed having the opportunity to connect my previous design knowledge with the topics of the course, such as photography for the website prototype and graphic design for the mobile app prototype. Although I enjoyed the aesthetics more than the user research (due to personal preferences), I found the latter important in designing the layout and content. <br> <br>I enjoyed the course well enough that I reached out to the lecturer to be an undergraduate tutor for the course in Winter Quarter 2025. I am now able to reflect on my projects and how I could have improved them while helping my peers learn Figma for prototyping and understand how to make their projects as user-friendly as possible. Figma is an online tool that allows designers to prototype products such as apps and websites. <br> <br> While most individuals only encounter the final version of a website or mobile app, a lot of thought, effort, and research goes into curating the visual and written content that is displayed for the target audience. Prior to college, I did not realize how much emphasis is placed on the users, but after taking a course and conducting further research, I understand how crucial it is to design for them. One overarching principle that UI/UX designers must focus on is designing for emotion, which was coined by Don Norman (Walter, 2011). Design remains one of the most personal careers (Walter, 2011). There are several ways to meet the needs of a website user. These are: functionality, reliability, and usability (Walter, 2011). If a website does not consistently react to a user's needs the way it is expected of them, an individual might decide it is unreliable and not use it again. The same can happen if it is difficult to use the website or there is no primary function. Thus, it is crucial for a designer to ensure that there is a purpose to the product and conduct testing to look into reliability and usability.<br> <br> In conjunction with designing for emotions, a UX designer can follow “laws” to strengthen the final website/application. Some of these include Jakob's Law, which refers to expectations of similar-looking products working the same way (Walter, 2011). This is important to consider when creating a website that has a similar function to existing ones so that users won't get confused and give up. In my UI/UX course, I was able to practice this law of UX by analyzing water agency websites while brainstorming mine in order to strengthen it as a final product. Another important law is known as Fitts's Law for usability, especially in regard to touch targets/buttons (Walter, 2011). While this law was formed in regard to physical objects, it can be transferred to the digital interface. Fitts's Law says that the larger the object, the less time it takes for someone to select it (Walter, 2011). Based on this, brands such as Apple have suggested minimum sizes and spacing to ensure users can easily select buttons (Walter, 2011). Designers should also follow the peak-end rule, which states that the focus should be on the most intense moment and the final moment of a user's interaction (Walter, 2011). Users are more likely to remember negative experiences and the aforementioned moments as related to a product (Walter, 2011). Therefore, designers should work to create seamless experiences, and perhaps add a moment of visualized reward for completing a task to keep the user positively engaged and coming back. </p>
