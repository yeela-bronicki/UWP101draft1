        <h2>UI/UX</h2>
        <p>In my experience, one of the most recommended upper division design courses at UC Davis is “Principles of UI/UX” (DES 112). <br> <br>TThe structure of this course helps students understand the foundations of UI/UX without going too deep due to the fast pace of the quarter system. Some memorable moments in the class are learning about the spectrum of pathways (ranging from designing to visuals to doing programming that ensures functionality). I got to learn that UI and UX design work together, but that an individual does not need to master both in order to find a job. UI relates to the interface of the design product, while UX focuses on the user experience. I found myself leaning toward UI (user interface) design and was pleasantly surprised that around half of the coursework was related to this. My preference in design projects has been focused on the visual design of things (whether it's a poster, website, or physical product), and creating prototypes was very similar. Each of the projects started out with brainstorming and researching demographics of the target audience to understand their needs. After creating this foundation, students worked on the interface of the website/app with focus on functionality. While I have found that all types of design require consideration of those who will use the final product, UI/UX especially emphasizes this. Reflecting on the work done in DES 112, many of the activities and smaller assignments within the projects provide insight into the kinds of jobs a designer can have within this field. These include UI designer (creating visually appealing interfaces that align with user needs), UX researcher (conducting interviews and usability testing) and UX writer (crafting content that is clear and user-friendly). <br> <br> While most individuals only encounter the final version of a website or mobile app, a lot of thought, effort, and research goes into curating the visual and written content that is displayed for the target audience. Prior to college, I did not realize how much emphasis is placed on the users, but after taking a course and conducting further research, I understand how crucial it is to design for them. <br> <br>One overarching principle that UI/UX designers must focus on is designing for emotion, which was coined by Don Norman (Walter, 2011). Design remains one of the most personal careers (Walter, 2011). Norman is an author, researcher, and former professor who is known for his advancements in user-centered design. There are several ways to meet the needs of a website user. These are: functionality, reliability, and usability (Walter, 2011). If a website does not consistently react to a user’s needs the way it is expected of them, an individual might decide it is unreliable and not use it again. The same can happen if it is difficult to use the website or there is no primary function. Thus, it is crucial for a designer to ensure that there is a purpose to the product and conduct testing to look into reliability and usability. In DES112, students practice usability testing by using paper sketches of their design ideas to see how a classmate might “click” to move through the different tasks before moving onto working in Figma (an online tool for creating static and interactive prototypes). <br> <br> In conjunction with designing for emotions, a UX designer can follow “laws” to strengthen the final website/application. <br> <br> Some of these include Jakob's Law, which refers to expectations of similar-looking products working the same way (Walter, 2011). This is important to consider when creating a website that has a similar function to existing ones so that users won't get confused and give up. In my UI/UX course, I was able to practice this law of UX by analyzing water agency websites while brainstorming mine in order to strengthen it as a final product. Another important law is known as Fitts's Law for usability, especially in regard to touch targets/buttons (Walter, 2011). While this law was formed in regard to physical objects, it can be transferred to the digital interface. Fitts's Law says that the larger the object, the less time it takes for someone to select it (Walter, 2011). Based on this, brands such as Apple have suggested minimum sizes and spacing to ensure users can easily select buttons (Walter, 2011).  <br> <br> Designers should also follow the peak-end rule, which states that the focus should be on the most intense moment and the final moment of a user's interaction (Walter, 2011). Users are more likely to remember negative experiences and the aforementioned moments as related to a product (Walter, 2011). Therefore, designers should work to create seamless experiences, and perhaps add a moment of visualized reward for completing a task to keep the user positively engaged and coming back. <br> <br> Knowing these rules is highly important for a future career in UX, and will advance coursework. </p>
