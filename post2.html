        <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
        <p>Whenever I talk to a new acquaintance about my major, they ask if I'm studying graphic design. Given the popularity of this field within the design program here at UC Davis and people who don't know much about it, I chose to highlight this discipline to combine multiple sources of information about it and possible careers related to graphic design. <br> <br>The introductory course for graphic design at Davis is called “Graphics & The Computer.” This class focuses on creating a foundational knowledge of graphic design principles and the basics of the needed software (namely Photoshop and Illustrator). While some students, like me, come into the course with prior experience using Adobe apps, it's helpful to experienced and new students alike. While the main focus was on skills needed for more advanced courses, we also had the opportunity to read a textbook written by professionals in design that provided further foundation. <br> <br> Two upper-division courses more directly related to graphic design are DES 115 (Letterforms and Type) and DES 116 (Visual Communication: Graphic Design). The former practices using fonts/typefaces to create visually appealing layouts in several smaller projects, while the latter focused on a broader project encompassing the whole 10 weeks. Examples of assignments include a brand book with design guidelines and layout design for a printed “book.” These two courses gave me a taste of the wide variety of work within this discipline and prepared me to take on a full-time summer internship. <br> <br> I have also had the opportunity to practice my graphic design skills in courses more related to other disciplines such as industrial design, UI/UX, and web design as I created posters, process books, and web page layouts for my coursework. <br> <br> While graphic design may seem like one of the simplest options —since anyone with a Canva account can put together a poster—, this discipline is much more complex than that. For example, the current industry standard is proficiency in the Adobe Creative Suite, namely Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. There are many “basics” involved in creating a composition, such as texture, color, and more (Lupton & Phillips, 2015). When it comes to selecting colors for a design project, more consideration needs to be given than simply what colors the designer or client likes. The energy and mood change depending on whether analogous or complementary colors are used (Lupton & Phillips, 2015). Analogous colors are those that sit next to each other on the color wheel and therefore create less contrast (Lupton & Phillips, 2015). Complementary colors are opposites on the wheel and create more contrast (Lupton & Phillips, 2015). Additionally,  Lupton and Phillips demonstrate that texture is a foundation of graphic design (2015). Similar to how textures in our environment signal to us where we are (along with visuals), the use of digital texture in graphic design varies based on the end goal of the composition— such as where it will be displayed or what message is being conveyed (Lupton & Phillips, 2015).
