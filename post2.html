        <h2>Graphic Design</h2>
        <p>Whenever I talk to a new acquaintance about my major, they ask if I’m studying graphic design. Given the popularity of this field within the design program here at UC Davis and people who don’t know much about it, I chose to highlight this discipline to combine multiple sources of information about it and possible careers related to graphic design. <br> <br>One of the first design courses us UC Davis students take is called “Graphics & The Computer.” It focuses on creating a foundational knowledge of graphic design principles and the basics of the needed software (namely Photoshop and Illustrator). While some students, like me, come into the course with prior experience using Adobe apps, it’s helpful to experienced and new students alike. While the main focus was on skills needed for more advanced courses, we also had the opportunity to read a textbook written by professionals in design that provided further foundation in design principles. <br> <br> Two upper-division courses more directly related to graphic design are DES 115 (Letterforms and Type) and DES 116 (Visual Communication: Graphic Design Studio). The former practices using fonts/typefaces to create visually appealing layouts in several smaller projects, while the latter focused on a broader project encompassing the whole 10 weeks. Examples of assignments include a brand book with design guidelines (DES 116) and layout design for a printed book (DES 115). Together, these courses provide a broad overview of what a graphic designer could work on in future jobs.<br> <br> Many other classes offered involve projects which benefit from graphic design skills. Courses such as Industrial Design (165) and Introduction to Interior Design: Residential (DES134A) require posters to present the sketches and prototypes completed. The web design courses (DES 117, 157A, 157B) also use graphic design as students create layouts for their web pages and websites. Both the graphic design courses and others provide insight into the kinds of projects a career graphic designer could be in charge of. <br> <br> WWhile graphic design may seem like one of the simplest options —since anyone can use Canva to put together a poster—, this discipline is much more complex than that. For example, the current industry standard is proficiency in the Adobe Creative Suite, namely Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. In order to be strong designers, we need to know how to use these programs and some foundational concepts outlined in this next section. <br> <br>   There are many “basics” involved in creating a composition, such as texture, color, and more (Lupton & Phillips, 2015). When it comes to selecting colors for a design project, more consideration needs to be given than simply what colors the designer or client likes. The energy and mood change depending on whether analogous or complementary colors are used (Lupton & Phillips, 2015). Analogous colors are those that sit next to each other on the color wheel and therefore create less contrast (Lupton & Phillips, 2015). Complementary colors are opposites on the wheel and create more contrast (Lupton & Phillips, 2015). Additionally,  Lupton and Phillips demonstrate that texture is a foundation of graphic design (2015). Similar to how textures in our environment signal to us where we are (along with visuals), the use of digital texture in graphic design varies based on the end goal of the composition— such as where it will be displayed or what message is being conveyed (Lupton & Phillips, 2015). <br> <br> Based on my search for jobs and internships, graphic designers can find a career in almost any industry. I have seen postings for working with tech companies such as Google and Apple, transit services such as Caltrain and BART, and smaller design firms. While the scope can be quite broad, I have deduced that most responsibilities for a graphic designer relate to advertising such as flyers, graphics for web pages, and signage.
