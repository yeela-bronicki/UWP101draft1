        <h2>Connections & Conclusion</h2>
        
        <p>Throughout my studies and research, one aspect of design has tied the rest together. It's typography, or the use of typefaces (more commonly known as fonts outside of the design world). <br> <br> There is a lot of information that's important to know about letterforms (letters). Ellen Lupton, a well known designer has written and revised a book about type (which UC Davis design students read for class) and highlighted several important features. These include the height and width of letters, typeface classification, and how to choose a typeface (Lupton 2024).<br> <br> Without delving too deep into these (as typography is viewed as a separate discipline), understanding these features of letterforms is crucial in creating strong products for graphic, UI/UX, and web design. <br> <br> In graphic design, it's important to consider the height and width of the letters as printed materials can't be zoomed in the same way web-based products can. Additionally, whether a typeface is serif (like Times New Roman) or sans-serif (like Arial) affects readability. For this reason, serif fonts are typically used for titles/headings, and sans serif fonts are used for body content (like this blog). Manipulating the sizing of letterforms and their proximity can be used to create digital textures (mentioned briefly in the graphic design post of this blog). <br> <br> In UI/UX and web design, choosing type is equally important. Functionally speaking, if an individual goes onto a website and cannot figure out what the content is, the product has “failed.” There are some of the same foundational rules for choosing fonts and sizing as in graphic design. For example, the minimum point size for body text (such as what you're reading right now) is suggested to be 11-12 pt (or 16 pixels). Many websites may choose to start with 16pt fonts for easier readability. <br> <br> In both print and web-based designs, typography sets a visual hierarchy that lets the user know what's most important and how to navigate the composition. <br> <br> I hope my more in-depth posts about graphic design, UI/UX, and web design, and this brief introduction to their connections and typography inspires you to learn more about them and form your own connections. I also hope for fellow UC Davis design students that you learned enough about some of the course offerings and are interested in some. </p>
